# Overview
This project contains Retrieval Augmented Generation(RAG) using open source models, the models are pulled from ollama. Specifically the models used here are gemma-2 as LLM and nomic-embed-text to generate embeddings, the output is then fine tuned with the help of lang chain and also there is a support to upload a pdf and ask questions to it
## For understandding the architecture of RAG read this blog:
